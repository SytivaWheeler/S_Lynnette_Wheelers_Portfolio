# Popcorn: A Movie Referral Webapp
This is Popcorn! It is a web app that acts as a way for anyone to find shows or movies from multiple streaming services and save them to a list they can refer back to whenever they want to look for something new to watch. It utilizes the API of multiple different streaming services to allow its users to search for movies or shows based on genre. Microsoft Azure and SQL are used to save user info and their lists to a database. CSS, Javascript, HTML and PHP are used for the frontend/backend.
